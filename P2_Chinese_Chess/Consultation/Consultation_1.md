# Consultation 1 --Chinese chess

1. No need to update chess board every turn, what we have to do is to use mlapp to update every chess's location.
2. The game UI should have two chess board on one device for 2 players to play, one player one chess board.
3. We have to reconsider the draw situation. When playing game with AI, we can easily judge whether the game is a draw or not. However, when we play it with our friends, it is better to achieve consensus on the final result.
4. For a consultation, it is always better to show the UI or some graphic information to the professor rather than the long documents.
5. Next, we will work on the UI and realize the basic functions.
