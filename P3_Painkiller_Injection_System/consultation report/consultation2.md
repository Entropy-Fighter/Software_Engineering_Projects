Suggestionï¼š

1."Inject Bolus" button should only appear on the UI of the patient, not the  physician UI.

So delete the button "Inject Bolus"on physician UI.

2.Current time should be displayed on dashboard instead of text area.

3.Inject amount limit per hour means the amount limit from 1 hour ago to new, instead of from the beginning of the hour to now. For example, if it is 8:40 now. The amount limit is calculated from 7:40-8:40,not from 8:00-8:40. 



Question and Answer

Q1 What function should be added ?

Add a curve that shows the function of time and injection amount



Q2 Will the aesthetics of the UI be taken into account when grading ?

No grades are assigned on aesthetics,but try to make it pleasing.
