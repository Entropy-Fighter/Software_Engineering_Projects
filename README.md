## Introduction

There are 3 projects(Banking system, Chinese chess, Painkiller injection system) in the course,  I do these projects with my teammates, caoster and zdy.  In each project's folder, there are source code, documents(user manual, requirement, specification, traceability, validation) and consultation reports.
