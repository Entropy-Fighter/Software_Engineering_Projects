Consultation1

​	Suggestion：

1. showing a simple UI would be better for teacher and TA to give advice 
2. Due to limitation of time, it is not necessary to introduce detail of  variable and function word by word,just try to figure out the main idea.




 Answer of question :

Q1 Is it acceptable to modify requirement part if some function are found hard to implement or useless in the procedure of implementation.

Yes,it is acceptable.

Q2 Is it necessary to implement all the function in the first prototype.

It is not necessary, a prototype with basic function should be done first, and then add more function in later version.

Q3 is  there any strict deadline for UML or UI

 There is no strict deadline, but it is recommanded to finish them earlier since it is helpful for teacher and TA to give suggestions.
